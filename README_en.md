## 1. Project Overview
### 1.1. Background
Wild Rift is the mobile version of League of Legends, gaining popularity for its fast-paced gameplay and mobile-optimized controls. However, the official website and related promotional pages were not effectively conveying the brand's unique worldview, character personalities, and gameplay styles, with room for improvement in terms of visual immersion and information delivery. Particularly for new users, the complex information structure and lack of visual guidance made access difficult, while for existing users, content updates and event information delivery was fragmented.

</br>

The purpose of this project is as follows:

</br>

1. Actively utilize League of Legends IP to visually emphasize the worldview and character personalities.     
2. Design a structure that clearly delivers game content information.         
3. Implement a design that provides an immersive user experience for both new and existing users.

</br>

2. **Accessibility**     
    2.1. Restructuring information hierarchy      
    
</br>

3. **User Acquisition and Retention**    
    3.1. Visually emphasize the latest content such as new champions and seasonal events to attract user interest          
    3.2. Naturally induce user acquisition by incorporating familiar elements (worldview, champion backgrounds, etc.) for existing PC players         
    

</br>
</br>
</br>
